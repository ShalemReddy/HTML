            <h3>Solider Monitoring System</h3>
            <p>This document describes a project to track soldiers and monitor their health status during war using sensors, GPS, and GSM. The system includes sensors to monitor a soldier's pulse rate and temperature, along with a GPS module to track location. If the soldier's pulse drops below 60 or their coordinates exceed a certain range, the system will automatically make an emergency call through the GSM module to alert others. The goal is to allow army personnel to plan strategies based on real-time soldier location and health data. The system uses an ARM7 microcontroller to process data from the sensors and GPS and communicate through GSM when needed.
